## Overview
- Initial fluid/solid positions are defined based on input trimeshes 
- Within the simulation loop:
    - A buffer zone is created surrounding the fluid
    - Velocity field updated based on particle velocities
    - Velocity field updated based on external forces (gravity) 
    - Velocity field into and out of solids is set to 0
    - Divergence is removed from the velocity field
    - Particle positions are updated based on velocity field
    - Particle positions are output 
- Marching cubes is used to produce a trimesh, which is then rendered

## Extensions
- Adding additional fluid to simulation
- Adding foam particles to simulation when cell curl above given value
