- MacGrid.cpp
- Reconstruction.cpp

## Overview
- Initial fluid/solid positions are defined based on input trimeshes 
- Within the simulation loop:
    - A buffer zone is created surrounding the fluid
    - Velocity field updated based on particle velocities
    - Velocity field updated based on external forces (gravity) 
    - Velocity field into and out of solids is set to 0
    - Divergence is removed from the velocity field
    - Particle positions are updated based on velocity field
    - Particle positions are output at regular intervals
- Within the reconstruction pipeline:
    - Particle positions are converted to signed distance fields
    - Marching cubes is used to produce a trimesh
    - The trimeshes are renedered in Blender 

## Extensions
- Adding additional fluid to simulation by adding fluid source or turning solids into fluids
- Adding foam particles to simulation when cell curl above given value
